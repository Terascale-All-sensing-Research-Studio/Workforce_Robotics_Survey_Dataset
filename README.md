# Dataset of Worker Perceptions of Workforce Robotics Regarding Safety, Independence, and Job Security

## Summary of Dataset
The dataset consists of a single Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file of the survey responses consisting of 338 rows, including a header row, and 40 columns. The data is provided in raw format, but filtered to excludes entries from participants who did not wish to have their responses publicly released. The 337 non-header rows in our dataset represents the complete responses provided by the participants. The 40 columns contain responses for the 40 questions broken into sections as follows: 


| Section |	Number of Questions	| Columns in Data |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Participant demographics |	7	| 1 to 7 |
| Perceptions toward physical safety |	8	| 8 to 15 |
| Perceptions towards working with coworkers |	6	| 16 to 21 |
| Perceptions towards working with robots	| 16 |	22 to 37 |
| Perceptions towards data privacy on robots	| 3 |	38 to 40 |
| Total Questions	| 40 |  |	

For each section we provide the list of questions and possible response values below. Possible response values are separated by a semi-colon, i.e. ";'. For questions that did not have a multiple choice option we indicate the type of entry, i.e. Text Box, in the Possible Values column. All multiple choice question responses were single choice except where the question indicates "select all that apply".

## Perceptions Towards Data Privacy on Robots Questions and Possible Response Values

The following questions were asked to participants to garner perceptions towards privacy when robots use different forms of sensing to determine need for assistance:

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 38 | To detect whether you need help, the robot may have to record data about you, e.g., it may need to record your audio to hear your request, or it may need to record video to determine if you are struggling.
